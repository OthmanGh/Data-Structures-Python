# List: Find Max Min ( ** Interview Question)
# Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values in the list.

# The function should have the following signature:

# def find_max_min(myList):


# Where myList is the list of integers to search for the maximum and minimum values.

# The function should traverse the list and keep track of the current maximum and minimum values. It should then return these values as a tuple, with the maximum value as the first element and the minimum value as the second element.

# For example, if the input list is [5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 9], the function should return (9, 1) since 9 is the maximum value and 1 is the minimum value.


def find_max_min(list):
    max = 0
    min = 0

    for i in range(1, len(list)):

        max = i if list[i] > list[max] else max
        min = i if list[i] < list[min] else min

    
    return (list[max], list[min])


print(find_max_min([5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 9]) )


"""
    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
    (9, 1)
    
"""
